# Town-Planning-Analytics
Town Planning Analytics is a python-based project used to analyse demographic trends of a mock census data (CSV format), representing demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, location etc. The dataset was designed to be representative of real census data and the analysis is used to make informed decisions for town planning and development.

This project demonstrates data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques using Python libraries. In this project, the population structure was visualised using a population pyramid to better understand the age and gender distribution within the population.

## Project Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared raw census data for analysis, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into demographic trends and patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative visualizations including a population pyramid, using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present the census data in a clear and informative manner.

## Data Analysis

To inform decision-making, various analyses were conducted including:

- **Age Distribution**: Understanding future demographic trends based on age distribution.
- **Unemployment Trends**: Identifying areas needing employment support through unemployment trends analysis.
- **Religious Affiliations**: Assessing demand for religious buildings by analyzing religious affiliations.
- **Marriage and Divorce Rates**: Informing housing decisions based on marriage and divorce rates.
- **Housing Occupancy Levels**: Optimizing housing development based on occupancy levels.
- **University Student Numbers**: Understanding commuting patterns through analysis of university student numbers.

## Town Planning

The purpose of the analysis is to informed make decisions for town planning and development:

- **Infrastructure Development**: Determine which infrastructure is to be prioritized for the town, considering options like housing, a train station, a religious building, or an emergency medical center.
- **Investment Priorities**: Decide where to invest resources, such as employment and training, old age care, schooling, or general infrastructure.
